Blumenthal wrote that if the report is accurate \"U.S. Soccer\\'s approach to domestic violence and family violence is at best superficial and at worst dangerously neglectful and self-serving.\"',\n",
       "  'This situation is well beyond Solo now. U.S. Soccer has made this a referendum about its own ability to represent the values of the nation. \"As boys and girls tune into Friday\\'s game, watching the women on TV as role models,\" Blumenthal wrote, \"what is the message of starting Hope Solo at goal?\"',\n",

       "  '\"U.S. Soccer takes the issue of domestic violence very seriously. From the beginning, we considered the information available and have taken a deliberate and thoughtful approach regarding Hope Solo\\'s status with the national team. Based on that information, U.S. Soccer stands by our decision to allow her to participate with the team as the legal process unfolds. If new information becomes available we will carefully consider it.\"',\n",

It's clear from Monday's dominant performance in a 3-1 tournament-opening win over Australia that Solo is not distracted by the national discussion of her past, so a short appearance – even without reporters' questions – probably won't ruin the U.S.'s chances for a trophy. And claiming that Solo has a match to focus on isn't credible as it's basically an admission that a single game is more important than a discussion of domestic violence.\",\n",
       "  \"For Gulati, there is little excuse. The silence, the lack of punishment and then the decision to allow head coach Jill Ellis to discuss (or not discuss) the situation here, combines to make the top official of American soccer look like he doesn't prioritize this issue.\",\n",
       "  '\"In the wake of this violent incident, U.S. Soccer offered no comment publicly for three months,\" Blumenthal wrote. \"It finally issued a statement that was purportedly the result of a \\'deliberate and thoughtful approach\\' to consider the incident and determine Hope Solo\\'s status with the team, but it neglected to include an effort to contact the alleged victims.\"',\n",
       "  'The more U.S. Soccer tries to shift focus to the field, the less it accomplishes that.

       "  'It ensures apps use the lowest amount of storage space on a device by only downloading the parts it needs run on the particular handset it is being installed onto.',\n",
